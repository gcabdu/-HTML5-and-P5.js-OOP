# HTML5-and-P5.js-OOP

## Description
The HTML5-and-P5.js-OOP project utilizes HTML5, P5.js, and Object-Oriented Programming techniques to create multiple animated shapes on a canvas that respond to mouse movement. The goal is to make the shapes chase the mouse pointer, rather than follow it directly, and to rotate shapes such as rectangles or triangles to reflect the position of the mouse. This project showcases the power of combining modern web technologies with OOP principles to create interactive and dynamic visualizations.

## Features
- Animated shapes that chase the mouse pointer
- Rotation of shapes based on mouse position
- Implementation using P5.js for canvas manipulation
- Object-Oriented Programming structure

## Prerequisites
- Web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox)
- Basic understanding of JavaScript and HTML

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/gcabdu/-HTML5-and-P5.js-OOP.git

2. **Navigate to Directory:**
   ```sh
   cd -HTML5-and-P5.js-OOP

3. **Open index.html in a web browser:**
   Simply open the index.html file in your preferred web browser to see the project in action.

## Project Structure
- index.html: Main HTML file that sets up the canvas and includes scripts.
- javascript.js: JavaScript file containing the P5.js code and OOP implementations.
- p5.min.js: Minified P5.js library.

## Usage

1. **Open `index.html` in a web browser:**
   Simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser to see the project in action.

2. **Interact with the canvas:**
   Move your mouse over the canvas to see the shapes animate and rotate based on the position of the mouse pointer.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: Main HTML file that sets up the canvas and includes scripts.
- `javascript.js`: JavaScript file containing the P5.js code and OOP implementations.
