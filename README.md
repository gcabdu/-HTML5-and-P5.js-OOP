# HTML5-and-P5.js-OOP

## Description
The HTML5-and-P5.js-OOP project is implemented using HTML5, P5.js, and Object-Oriented Programming. It features multiple eradicating shapes on a canvas created in response to the mouse’s movement. However, the objective was to make the shapes pursue/get to the mouse, rather than simply follow after it. Additionally, several shapes including rectangles and triangles should be rotated to demonstrate the mouse’s position. The project can be used to demonstrate how modern web technologies and Object-Oriented Programming can be combined to produce dynamic and interactive visualization.

## Features
- Animated shapes that chase the mouse pointer
- Rotation of shapes based on mouse position
- Implementation using P5.js for canvas manipulation
- Object-Oriented Programming structure

## Prerequisites
- Web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox)
- Basic understanding of JavaScript and HTML

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/gcabdu/-HTML5-and-P5.js-OOP.git

2. **Navigate to Directory:**
   ```sh
   cd -HTML5-and-P5.js-OOP

3. **Open index.html in a web browser:**
   Simply open the index.html file in your preferred web browser to see the project in action.

## Project Structure
- index.html: Main HTML file that sets up the canvas and includes scripts.
- javascript.js: JavaScript file containing the P5.js code and OOP implementations.
- p5.min.js: Minified P5.js library.

## Usage

1. **Open `index.html` in a web browser:**
   Simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser to see the project in action.

2. **Interact with the canvas:**
   Move your mouse over the canvas to see the shapes animate and rotate based on the position of the mouse pointer.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: Main HTML file that sets up the canvas and includes scripts.
- `javascript.js`: JavaScript file containing the P5.js code and OOP implementations.
- `p5.min.js`: Minified P5.js library.
